# CodilityPracticeLessons
These are perfect-score (100%) solutions to Codility's practice lessons page located @ app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/.

You can freely use these solutions to study them and to write your own in a different programming language. You may not freely use these solutions to gain 100% marks in the Codility practice tests - this would cause no real usefulness at all. So, for example, if you see the solution in Go, study it and write your own in C#.

On top of each solution file is the link to the Codility practice test for you to see it is a perfect-score (100%) solution.

These sorts of problems are great for polishing your coding and algorithm-optimization skills.

You can find the problems @ https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/.
